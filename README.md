LoopieEngine is a video game engine created by Adrià García, Ana Alcázar and Pol Sierra, video game development and design students from CITM, university affiliated with the UPC in Barcelona. This engine was created as a project for the Game Engines course. For the third assignment, Loopie Engine was chosen to serve as the base to build the different systems on top of it. Our group, consisting of Pau González, Noa Pont and Judit Parras, was responsible of implementing the Scripting System. We decided to integrate Mono and use C# as the scripting language.
